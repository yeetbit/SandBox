If you want to do the conversion to UEFI, make sure you backed-up everything. Including your files from the windows install.

* Create a Bootable Manjaro USB

* During bios startup select one of the two UEFI partitions to start the Manjaro USB from. ***Don't select the USB drive itself, this will set your boot mode in MBR*** 

----------------------------------------------------
**Then:** the easiest way would be fresh install. 
@ the Manjaro installer, select manual partitioning. 

* **EFI partition**: Select the /dev/sda1 boot partition > select mount point **/boot/efi** or **/efi**. **DO NOT SELECT FORMAT**
In the lower part of the installer window it says something like, "here we going to install the grub bootloader"

* **Manjaro root partition**: select the partition you already used for your previous install: /dev/sda4 select reformat filesystem ext4 > select mount point **/** (root).

*  **swap**: select the partition you already used, /dev/sda3 select filesystem swap > mount point swap

* continue installation normally
------------------------------

  

**Alternatively:** You have the option to convert your linux install to uefi, but it can a be a bit tricky. And potentially could ruin your windows bootloader.
